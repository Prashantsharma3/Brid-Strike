# Bird Strike Analysis in the Airline Industry

## Overview
Bird strikes pose a significant risk to aircraft safety, resulting in millions of dollars in damage and potential loss of life each year. This project aims to analyze bird strike data in the airline industry to understand patterns, trends, and potential mitigation strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains records of bird strikes reported by various airlines. It includes information such as date, time, location, aircraft type, and severity of the bird strike.

## Analysis
  The analysis involves:

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of bird strikes over time, location, and aircraft type.
    Identification of high-risk areas and seasons for bird strikes.
    Assessment of the impact of bird strikes on aircraft safety and financial costs.
    Development of recommendations for airlines and aviation authorities to mitigate the risk of bird strikes.
# Dashboard
A dashboard has been created to visualize the analysis findings. It includes interactive charts and maps to explore bird strike data dynamically.
